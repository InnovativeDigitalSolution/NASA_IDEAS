# IDEAS
IDEAS (Intelligent Design and Engineering of Aerospace Systems) is an open-source project being directed by NASA's Glenn Research Center, in collaboration with Penn State University, UC Irvine, and Arizona State University. IDEAS will become a central hub for a vast amount of discovery tools that enhance our experimentation selection and allows us to combine new radical ideas from a variety of different of different domains. It will create full prototypes of aircraft building from the bottom up.</br></br>

To prototype this system, we boil down the application into a single, feasible benchmark problem in thermal management. The IDEAS prototype will feature an AI system that will create new, feasible heat exchanger designs:</br>
Develop a lightweight, multi-functional heat exchanger for waste heat recovery that allows more than 150kW of heat to be extracted from the gas turbine engine coreâ€™s exhaust nozzle with the overall objective to use waste heat in a productive manner.</br>
